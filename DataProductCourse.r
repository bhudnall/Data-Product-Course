## Idea for Project:
# Create shiny app that allows user to upload a file in either wide or long format
# After file is uploaded the app asks users to pick variables to include in analysis
# Must indicate whether the variables are the independent or dependent variables
# also indicate if the independant variables are factor variables
# from there do a visualization of the independent variables

# After that run a simple linear model and a logistic regression model
# Then, ren a stepwise model to find the best regresson model

## From there, show charts for regression model.
# show charts residuals vs. fitted, normal Q-Q,
# scale-location, and residuals vs. leverage
